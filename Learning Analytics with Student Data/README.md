# Learning Analytics with Student Data

This is my first project in my undergraduate study. I did not have much  experience and there are many aspects that can be improved.

## Potential Improvements:

1. Use Support vector Machine or Random Forest instead of Classification tree. (deep neural network will not work well as the data size is small)

2. Create some new features from data given.
