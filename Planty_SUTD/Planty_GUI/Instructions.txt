This GUI consists of three screens: Home, Graph and Info. The interface looks simple and clear and all the real-time data is processed in the program that supports the GUI. The data and graph are auto-updated every 10 seconds so that users will get all the information about the plant as well as the predictions for the smart watering system easily.
